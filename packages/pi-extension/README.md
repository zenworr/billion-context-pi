## Why?

When conversations get long, the model runs out of context. Most tools hard-truncate — silently dropping earlier messages. **billion-context** gives the model a `compress` tool: the LLM decides **when** and **what** to compress into high-fidelity summaries, preserving critical details (file paths, decisions, error strings) while reclaiming context space.

Unlike Pi's built-in auto-compaction (which replaces everything with a single summary), billion-context:
- **Preserves structure** — compressed ranges become labeled blocks you can decompress later
- **Multi-tier** — summaries can be further distilled (T1 → T2 → T3) as sessions grow
- **Searchable** — `search_context` finds information inside compressed blocks without decompressing
- **Selective** — protected tools, user messages, and the recent working set are never compressed

This means:

1. **A single session handles enormous workloads.** Per simulation tests of the three-tier architecture (see [opencode-acp](https://github.com/ranxianglei/opencode-acp)), one session can process on the order of 10–60 billion cumulative tokens — while retaining long-term memory of distant key information (paths, decisions, signatures). You can work in the **same session for months** without outgrowing the context.
2. **Context stays lean over the long run.** In practice context typically holds under ~150K tokens (opencode-acp keeps it under ~200K), so compared to traditional compaction that lets context balloon toward 1M, **a single session costs roughly 5× less in tokens**.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:billion-context-pi
```

That's it. The extension auto-loads on next Pi startup. No configuration needed — it reads your model's context window automatically.

> **Uninstall `pi-subagents` first (optional, recommended).** billion-context-pi ships its own `acp_delegate` sub-agent tool (see below) that replaces pi-subagents at a fraction of the context cost (~600 tok vs ~7K tok/turn). If you have pi-subagents installed, remove it to avoid duplicate delegation tools:
> ```bash
> pi remove npm:pi-subagents
> ```

## How it works

billion-context intercepts Pi's `context` event (fired before each LLM call) and runs an 8-stage pipeline:

```
assign refs → sync blocks → prune → filter → hide calls → recommend → nudge → emergency truncate
```

Each message gets an invisible `<acp>` ref tag (`m00001`, `m00002`, ...) visible to the model but not the user. The model uses these refs to specify compression ranges.

Pi's built-in compaction remains the checkpoint and overflow-recovery path. ACP cancels a threshold compaction only after a verified, materially smaller compiled projection is already safe.

## Plugin compatibility & ordering

billion-context takes over context management by intercepting Pi's `context` event. **Pi has no plugin priority mechanism** — when multiple extensions register handlers for the same event, they run in a fixed sequence (load order), with no `priority`/`weight` field and no way for the user to control the order. The `context` event specifically is a *pipeline*: every handler receives the previous handler's output, there is no short-circuit, and the **last** handler has the final say over what reaches the model.

This has two practical implications:

1. **Keep exactly one context-compression plugin installed.** If you run two compression plugins together (e.g. billion-context-pi alongside another), both will rewrite the message list and clobber each other's work — compressed ranges can be re-expanded or corrupted. Pi's built-in compaction remains available for checkpoints and overflow recovery. Any *third-party* context-rewriting extension should still be removed to avoid competing projections.

2. **Even with a single compression plugin, interference is still possible in rare cases.** Load order under Pi is determined by filesystem discovery order (`fs.readdirSync` over `.pi/extensions/` → global → packages), which is not fully deterministic. If another (non-compression) extension also hooks the `context` event and happens to load *after* billion-context-pi, it could modify the compressed output. billion-context-pi rebuilds its working set from the session log rather than the chained input, which makes it robust to handlers that run *before* it — but it cannot defend against a handler that runs *after* it. This is a limitation of Pi's extension model; if you observe unexpected context behavior, check whether other installed extensions intercept the `context` event.

## Model-facing tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `compress` | Replace a contiguous message range with a detailed summary |
| `decompress` | Restore a previously compressed block's content |
| `search_context` | Search compressed block summaries (and visible messages) by keyword |
| `acp_status` | Show context usage, compressed blocks, compressible ranges |
| `acp_delegate` | Spawn a clean-context sub-agent for a task (review / research / implement / plan / advise) |
| `acp_delegate_wait` | Block until a delegate run finishes (returns its result; times out otherwise) |
| `acp_delegate_cancel` | Cancel a running delegate by runId |

### acp_delegate — clean-context delegation

Hand a self-contained task to a fresh pi process running in a clean context. Five built-in roles, each with a system prompt and a **soft tool guardrail**:

| Role | Tools | Best for |
|------|-------|----------|
| `reviewer` | read, bash, grep, find, ls + ACP | Read-only code review (bugs, risks, file:line) |
| `researcher` | read, bash, grep, find, ls + ACP | Read-only codebase investigation |
| `worker` | read, edit, write, bash | Make code changes |
| `planner` | read, bash, grep, find, ls + ACP | Analyze + propose a step-by-step plan |
| `oracle` | read, bash, grep, find, ls + ACP | Answer questions / advise |

Read-only roles (reviewer, researcher, planner, oracle) receive a restricted tool allowlist (`read, bash, grep, find, ls`) plus ACP context tools (`compress, decompress, search_context, acp_status`) so they can manage their own context. This prevents accidental file modifications, but `bash` can bypass it - **it is a guardrail, not a security boundary**.

Worker runs on Pi's full default toolset - no `--tools` allowlist is applied, so any loaded extension or custom tools (e.g. ACP, LSP, MCP) remain available. This keeps primary-task delegation fully capable. The `read, edit, write, bash` listing above reflects core tools only.

The full delegate result is saved to a file (`/tmp/acp-delegate/<runId>.out`); the tool result and injected notification carry only the **task title + file path** (no preview) - use `read` for the details. This keeps the parent context lean.

- **Interactive (TUI) & RPC modes**: `async:true` (default) runs the child in the background; a short completion notification is injected into the chat when it finishes.
- **Print / JSON modes** (`pi -p`, SDK): `async:true` auto-downgrades to **synchronous** — the result returns as the tool result in the same turn (the parent exits after one turn, so background injection would be lost).

In the **interactive TUI**, async runs also show a live status widget below the editor (agent, elapsed seconds, task preview), so you always know what's running and for how long. Disabled automatically in RPC/print/JSON.

## Compression model commands

`/acp-model` selects an authenticated model that can write compression summaries. `/acp-settings` configures its thinking level and independently routes Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 to either the main model (default) or the configured model. Choices are saved globally in `~/.pi/acp.json`.

The main agent always decides when and what to compress. A configured compressor only writes the summary for the resolved range. If it fails, ACP reports the failure and falls back to the authenticated main model. Configured compressors require Pi 0.84.1 or newer.

## Configuration

billion-context-pi works out of the box with no configuration. Three optional keys can be set in a JSON config file.

### Config file

Create `~/.pi/acp.json` (global) and/or `<project>/.pi/acp.json` (project-local, overrides global):

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "modelContextLimit": 200000,
  "delegate": true,
  "toolBashDefaultTimeout": 60,
  "toolOutputMaxBytes": 200000,
  "compress": {
    "maxContextLimit": "75%",
    "emergencyThresholdPercent": "95%",
    "nudgeGrowthTokens": 50000,
    "model": "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
    "thinkingLevel": "medium",
    "tier1Compressor": "main",
    "tier2Compressor": "main",
    "tier3Compressor": "main"
  },

  "prompts": {
    "compressPhilosophy": "Override the compression philosophy...",
    "howToCompressRules": "Override tier-1 rules...",
    "tier2DistillRules": "Override tier-2 distillation rules...",
    "tier3CondenseRules": "Override tier-3 condensation rules..."
  },
  "acknowledgePromptsRisk": true
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `debug` | `false` | Enable verbose **debug-level** events in the log. The always-on log (lifecycle events, errors, warnings) is written regardless; `debug` only adds extra diagnostics. Also enabled by env `ACP_DEBUG=1`. |
| `autoUpdate` | `true` | On Pi startup, check npm for a newer version and auto-install it (throttled to one check per 3 minutes). Disable to avoid all startup network calls. |
| `modelContextLimit` | *(auto)* | Override the context limit (in tokens). Defaults to the model's `contextWindow`. |
| `delegate` | `true` | Enable the `acp_delegate` tools (delegate/wait/cancel) and their system-prompt section. Set `false` to skip registering them (e.g. you use a different sub-agent extension, or run headless where async injection adds no value). |
| `toolBashDefaultTimeout` | `60` | Seconds injected into the `bash` tool when the model omits `timeout`. Pi has **no** default of its own, so without this a forgotten timeout can hang for thousands of seconds. On timeout the model is guided to re-run with a larger `timeout`. `0` restores Pi's unbounded behavior. |
| `toolOutputMaxBytes` | `200000` | Hard byte cap on tool result text (~5000 lines at ~40 B/line; applied via the `tool_result` hook). Stops runaway output that Pi's own 50KB/2000-line cap can't catch (e.g. tools Pi doesn't cap). When it fires the model is told how to see the full output — for `bash` the full output is in its temp file (`BashToolDetails.fullOutputPath`); set lower (e.g. `8192`) for a tighter context budget, or `0` to disable. |
| `compress.maxContextLimit` | `"75%"` | Context usage threshold that triggers **forced compression** nudges (bypasses growth-gate + cadence). Accepts a ratio (`0.75`) or percent string (`"75%"`). Lower = compress earlier / more aggressively. |
| `compress.emergencyThresholdPercent` | `"95%"` | Context usage threshold that triggers **emergency truncation** of large tool outputs. Must be ≥ `compress.maxContextLimit`. |
| `compress.nudgeGrowthTokens` | `50000` | Token growth step for soft compression nudges. |
| `compress.model` | *(none)* | Authenticated `provider/model-id` selected by `/acp-model`. |
| `compress.thinkingLevel` | `"medium"` | Thinking level used by the configured model. |
| `compress.tier1Compressor` | `"main"` | Tier-1 summary writer: `"main"` or `"configured"`. |
| `compress.tier2Compressor` | `"main"` | Tier-2 summary writer: `"main"` or `"configured"`. |
| `compress.tier3Compressor` | `"main"` | Tier-3 summary writer: `"main"` or `"configured"`. |
| `prompts` | *(kernel defaults)* | Override acp-kernel's 4 load-bearing compression prompt rules (`compressPhilosophy`, `howToCompressRules`, `tier2DistillRules`, `tier3CondenseRules`). Each set field replaces the default verbatim; omitted fields are inherited. Non-string values are dropped. Requires `acknowledgePromptsRisk: true` — otherwise overrides are ignored and defaults are used. |
| `acknowledgePromptsRisk` | `false` | Safety gate for `prompts` overrides. Set `true` to acknowledge that replacing the tuned compression rules may reduce summary quality (lost paths/signatures/decisions → worse retrieval) and to make overrides take effect. |

> **Only documented keys are read from `acp.json`.** Other tuning knobs (`preserveRecentMessages`, `protectedTools`) are code-level and not user-overridable. Compression routing defaults to the main model for every tier.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `ACP_AUTO_UPDATE` | Set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off` (case-insensitive) to disable auto-update, overriding the config. |
| `ACP_MODEL_CONTEXT_LIMIT` | Override the context limit. Takes precedence over the config value. |
| `ACP_DEBUG` | Set to `1` or `true` to enable debug-level logging (always-on events are written regardless). |
| `ACP_LOG_FILE` | Override the log file path (default `~/.pi/acp.log`). |

### Logging

billion-context-pi writes a structured, always-on log to `~/.pi/acp.log` (override with `ACP_LOG_FILE`). It covers the model's whole working session and is useful for diagnosing problems:

- **Always written** (even with `debug: false`): `error`, `warn`, `info` levels — session start, every context turn (token usage / nudge decision), compress/decompress, delegate spawn/done, and **all errors and warnings** (config/state/tool failures, delegate errors, guardrail caps, update failures). Error lines include the message and stack trace.
- **Written only when `debug: true`**: verbose `debug`-level diagnostics (full field dumps, per-turn internals).

Each line: `<ISO timestamp> [<level>] [<scope>] key=value key=value`. The file rotates to `~/.pi/acp.log.old` at 10 MB.

```sh
tail -f ~/.pi/acp.log                 # watch the session live
grep '\[error\]' ~/.pi/acp.log        # surface every recorded failure
```

### Compression philosophy

The model receives detailed guidance (in its system prompt) on **when** to compress, **what** to keep verbatim (paths, signatures, errors, decisions, user intent), and **what** to drop (verbose logs, duplicates, consumed exploration). This guidance is injected on every turn so it stays in the model's attention.

### What gets protected

billion-context protects three categories of content from compression:

1. **Always-protected tools** — `compress` calls are hard-protected (they're load-bearing metadata; compressing them breaks decompress and the "summary is historical" contract).
2. **Soft recent-zone** — the last N messages (default 5) and last ~5K tokens are soft-protected so the model keeps its working set. Tool results from `decompress`, `search_context`, `read`, and `bash` are **excluded** from this zone: they're large and meant to be compressible once consumed, so they don't eat the protected budget.
3. **Last user message** — always protected (user intent must survive).

## Built on acp-kernel

The compression engine is [`acp-kernel`](https://github.com/ranxianglei/acp-kernel) — a platform-agnostic, MIT-licensed library with 208 tests. It's bundled inline into `dist/index.js`, so there are zero runtime dependencies.
