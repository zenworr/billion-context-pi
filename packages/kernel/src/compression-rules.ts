export const COMPRESS_PHILOSOPHY = `Compression Philosophy:
- All compression serves the primary task, but be frugal.
- Context capacity is precious. Save context by compressing consumed outputs, not by avoiding tools.
- Compress by need, not by percentage.
- Work from summaries, not raw tool outputs. All listed ranges (user prompts, tool outputs, code, logs, exploration, intermediate steps) should be compressed to summary format — the ONLY exceptions are protected content, content the current step is actively using, or critical content you cannot reconstruct.`;

export const HOW_TO_COMPRESS_RULES = `HOW TO COMPRESS

When you call \`compress\`, the summary you write becomes the only record of the replaced conversation. Make it self-contained and complete: every user request, experiment purpose, and work task in the range must be accurately captured. A later reader (or you, after decompressing) should be able to continue the task WITHOUT needing the original.

KEEP VERBATIM — never paraphrase or abbreviate these:
- Full file paths with line numbers, directory prefix on every mention (\`lib/hooks.ts:347\`, \`src/index.ts:12-18\`, \`gatenet_v3/model.py:45\`). Never abbreviate to a bare filename (\`hooks.ts\`, \`model.py\`) — they are ambiguous and cannot be grepped or decompressed-to later.
- Function, class, and type signatures (exact names, params, return types) AND critical code lines that encode logic — the line that IS the finding, not just the function name (e.g. \`kv_keys += define_gate * a_key[i](emb)\` is more useful than "see model_kvnet.py").
- Error messages and stack traces (exact text — you need the literal string to grep for it later).
- Key details from reports and analyses — not just the conclusion. Keep the comparison numbers and the mechanism, not "X is worse" alone (write "1.76× PPL gap because KV store is static", not "KVNet underperforms").
- Decisions and their rationale ("chose X over Y because Z" — the "because" is load-bearing; without it the decision looks arbitrary).
- Constraints discovered ("must support Node 22", "no new dependencies", "AGENTS.md forbids \`as any\`").
- Exact values: versions, config keys, thresholds, magic numbers.
- User intent — quote short user messages verbatim. When the message is too long to quote, preserve intent with extra care: do not change scope, constraints, priorities, acceptance criteria, or requested outcomes. Mark them clearly as past quotes (e.g., "User said: ..."), not as current directives. Losing these changes the task itself.
- The user's overall goal and any changes to it — the big-picture objective plus how it evolved during the compressed range. Each summary must reflect the goal as it stood at the end of the range, including pivots (e.g., "initially: fix bug X → pivoted to: refactor module Y after discovering root cause"). Losing the goal or its evolution makes all subsequent work appear unmotivated.
- Purpose behind each significant action — preserve not just what was done but why: the hypothesis behind each experiment, the question behind each exploration, the task goal behind each work action. Without purpose, the summary reads as disconnected technical steps with no through-line.
- Open questions and unresolved TODOs — losing these changes what work appears to remain.
- Message refs of key anchors (\`m00420\`, \`m00510–m00520\`) — they let you or a later reader jump back via decompress to the exact original.

DROP — extract the signal, discard the vessel:
- Verbose logs (build/test/\`npm\` output) once you have captured the error line or the result.
- Duplicate file reads once the needed content is recorded.
- Consumed exploration — search hits, agent return values, successful tool outputs — once you have extracted the facts you need (same rule as dead-ends, but nothing went wrong; the content is simply spent).
- Dead-end exploration — but PRESERVE the lesson in one line: "tried X, failed because Y".
- Back-and-forth discussion and self-corrections once the final position is captured (keep the outcome, drop the journey to it).
- Repeated status checks (\`git status\`, \`ls\`) once state is known.

For each significant item you DROP (scripts, reports, large analyses, long tool outputs), add a one-line CONTENT description of what it covers — not where it lives. Bad: "probe script at /path/probe_kvnet.py". Good: "probe_kvnet.py: tests n-gram baseline, generation quality, long-range dependency, position sensitivity, op pipeline, QUERY attention." This lets a later decompress target the right block by relevance, not by guessing locations.

PRIORITY — when the summary must be compact, preserve in this order:
1. User's overall goal, goal evolution, intent, and hard constraints (losing these changes the task).
2. Decisions and rationale.
3. Exact technical artifacts: paths, signatures, errors, values.
4. Conclusions and key findings.
5. Lessons learned: what failed and why.

Write dense, scannable bullets — not narrative prose. If the range spans distinct concerns (request → findings → decision), group bullets under short thematic headers so a reader can scan to the part they need. Every line must earn its place. Do not mimic the style of existing summaries in context; follow these rules.`;

export const TIER2_DISTILL_RULES = `TIER 2 COMPRESSION — DISTILLATION

You are compressing historical summaries (not raw conversation). These summaries have already captured the details. Your job is to DISTILL them: extract only what matters for future work, discard the process.

KEEP — these are the only things that survive distillation:
- Decisions and their rationale ("chose X over Y because Z" — the "because" is load-bearing).
- Final outcomes: version numbers shipped, PR numbers merged/closed, bugs fixed or deferred.
- Key lessons: what failed and why ("tried X, failed because Y"). These prevent repeating mistakes.
- Critical constraints discovered ("must support Node 22", "AGENTS.md forbids as any").
- Design decisions with architectural impact ("chose compress-as-anchor over synthetic messages because prefix cache").
- Whether content is OBSOLETE or SUPERSEDED — mark with one line: "[SUPERSEDED by PR #NNN]" or "[OBSOLETE: deleted in vX.Y.Z]". Do NOT keep the obsolete content's details — just the marker and reason.
- Function/class/type names and module paths that are the SUBJECT of the work — e.g., "fixed filterCompressedRanges in prune.ts", "added SessionStateRegistry in state.ts". Not exact line numbers or full signatures — just enough to LOCATE the code without searching.
- Exploration findings: if a block was exploratory with no decision, keep the CONCLUSION in one line ("explored X, not viable because Y"). Do not keep the exploration process.

DROP — these were useful during the work but are no longer needed:
- Exact line numbers, diffs, verbose function signatures, full code listings.
- Build/deploy process details, test execution steps.
- Review process details (who reviewed, what rounds, test counts).
- Verbose logs, command output, intermediate debugging steps.

FORMAT:
- Start each distilled block with a source header line:
  \`Source: bN+bM+... (XK→YK tok, Zx). [original topic]\`
  Example: \`Source: b5+b7 (56K+44K→268 tok, 375x). [Tool-result recap + publish]\`
- 3-5 bullet points per source block, each a self-contained fact.
- Dense, scannable — no narrative prose.
- Start with the outcome, not the process: "v1.13.0 shipped (7 PRs bundled)" not "implemented 7 PRs then reviewed then merged".
- Cross-block synthesis: if multiple source blocks cover the same topic (same PR, same feature, same bug), MERGE them into a single group of bullets. Do not repeat the same fact from different blocks — keep it once under the most relevant source header.

SIZE TARGET: 50-150 tokens per source block (excluding the header). If you can't fit it in 150 tokens, you're keeping too much process. If a block has nothing worth keeping (pure noise), output just the header followed by "[no actionable content]."`;

export const TIER3_CONDENSE_RULES = `TIER 3 COMPRESSION — ULTRA-CONDENSATION

You are compressing distilled summaries (Tier 2) into ultra-condensed facts (Tier 3). The distilled summaries already contain only decisions and outcomes. Your job is to reduce them to bare factual references.

PRIORITY — when a source block has more facts than the size target allows, keep in this order:
1. Shipped outcomes (versions released, PRs merged) — these are permanent record.
2. Open work (PRs/issues still pending) — these may need follow-up.
3. Key decisions with architectural impact ("chose X over Y because Z").
4. Critical constraints ("must support Node 22").
Drop everything else. Tier 3 is a lookup index, not a knowledge base.

FORMAT:
- Start with a source header line:
  \`Source: bN+bM+... (XK→YK tok, Zx). [original topic]\`
- Output 1-3 facts per source block. Each fact is a single line: subject + outcome.
- No explanations, no rationale, no process — just the fact.
- Format: "[PR/Issue/Version] — [outcome in ≤8 words]"
- Merge related facts from different source blocks if they concern the same topic.

EXAMPLES:
- "v1.13.0 shipped — quality gate + GC fix (7 PRs)"
- "PR #196 merged — preserve-first-user (supersedes #169)"
- "Bug 1214 fixed — compress consumed all user messages"
- "Chose compress-as-anchor — prefix cache benefit over synthetic injection"
- "Constraint: AGENTS.md forbids as any — never suppress types"

DROP:
- Multi-sentence context. If a fact needs >1 sentence, it's too detailed for Tier 3.
- Lessons learned ("tried X, failed because Y") — drop UNLESS the failure is likely to recur and the block is <30 days old.
- Design rationale details — keep the decision, drop the "because" unless it's a critical constraint.
- Anything marked [OBSOLETE] or [SUPERSEDED] — drop entirely, note "[N blocks obsolete]" in the summary.

SIZE TARGET: 30-60 tokens per source block (including header). For a batch of N source blocks, total output ≈ N × 40 tokens. If a source block has only one trivial fact, output just the header + one line.`;
